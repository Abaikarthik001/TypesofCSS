    <h3>Types of CSS</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Internal CSS</li>
            <li>External CSS</li>
            <li>Inine CSS</li>
        </ol>
    </h4>
    <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
        An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a "style" element. The following example sets the text color of ALL the h1 elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the p elements to red
    <h3>External CSS</h3>
        The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages. It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just one file.
        It uses the link tag on every pages and the link tag should be put inside the head section.
    <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
        The inline CSS is also a method to insert style sheets in HTML document. This method mitigates some advantages of style sheets so it is advised to use this method sparingly. If you want to use inline CSS, you should use the style attribute to the relevant tag.
